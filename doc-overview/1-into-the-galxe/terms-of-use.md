**Galaxy OAT**. Galaxy OAT aims to be a light-weight solutionfor event organizers and community
managers to utilize Project Galaxy’s NFT infrastructure and on-chain credential data network to
build and distribute NFT badge campaigns easily and reward their community members. To put
it simple, Galaxy OATs (on-chain achievement tokens) are a digital record of all your life's
achievements.

**3. Galaxy Token**

Project Galaxy aims to build a permissionless, open, and collaborative credential data network.
The Galaxy Token (“GAL”) token is an essential component to such infrastructures as it functions
as the governance token, incentivizes user participation, and serves as the primary payment
token of the Project Galaxy ecosystem. Here are the utilities of GAL:

- **Governance** : GAL is used for voting & governance inProject Galaxy Decntralized
    Autonomous Organization (“DAO”). GAL token holders have the ability to control the
    amount of the platform fee collected by the protocol, and control funds held by the
    Project Galaxy Community Treasury.
- **Paying for Application Module Fee** : Developers whoaim to utilize Galaxy’s credential
    data through Application Modules will be subject to a platform fee (“Platform Fee”)
    which is charged in GAL.
- **Paying for Galaxy Oracle Engine and Galaxy Credential API** : Developers pay GAL to
    query our credential data through Galaxy Oracle Engine and Galaxy Credential API.
    Currently all query fees are waived during beta testing.
- **Curating Digital Credentials** : Curators can utilizethe GAL token to signal a credential
    data set’s value. Each credential data set will include a revenue stream that will be split
    between credential stake holders pro-rata.


**4. Digital Wallet**

**9. DMCA Notice and Procedure for Copyright Infringement Claims**

As Project Galaxy asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the
intellectual property rights of others. Project Galaxy, in appropriate circumstances, may remove
from the Services information that might infringe the intellectual property rights of others.

**a) Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements**

If you believe your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes copyright
infringement and such infringement is occurring on the Project Galaxy Services, you may submit
a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our
Designated Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further
detail):

```
● Anelectronicorphysicalsignatureofthepersonauthorizedtoactonbehalfof
the owner of the copyright’s interest;
● A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed,
includingtheURL(i.e.,webpageaddress)ofthelocationwherethecopyrighted
work exists or a copy of the copyrighted work;
● IdentificationoftheURLorotherspecificlocationontheProjectGalaxyServices
where the material that you claim is infringing is located; your address,
telephone number, and E-mail address;
● Astatementbyyouthatyouhaveagoodfaithbeliefthatthedisputeduseisnot
authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
● Astatementbyyou,madeunderpenaltyofperjury,thattheaboveinformation
inyournoticeisaccurateandthatyouarethecopyrightownerorauthorizedto
act on the copyright owner's behalf.
```
You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your
DMCA notice may not be valid and we will have no obligation to respond or acknowledge
receipt of your notice. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and
attorneys’ fees) if you misrepresent or make bad faith claims that any material on the Project
Galaxy Services infringes your copyrights. You can contact our Designated Agent via e-mail at
DMCA@galaxy.eco.

THE DESIGNATED AGENT SHOULD BE CONTACTED ONLY IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR WORK HAS
BEEN USED OR COPIED IN A WAY THAT CONSTITUTES COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND SUCH
INFRINGEMENT IS OCCURRING ON THE PROJECT GALAXY SERVICES. ALL OTHER INQUIRIES
DIRECTED TO THE DESIGNATED AGENT WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

**b) Receipt of Proper Infringement Notification**


Once a proper bona fide infringement notification has been received by the Designated Agent,
it is Project Galaxy’s policy:

```
● To remove or disable access to the infringing content;
● Tonotifythecontentprovider,member,oruser(“ ContentProvider ”)thatithas
removed or disabled access to the content; and
● Thatrepeatoffenderswillhavetheinfringingcontentremovedfromthesystem
andthatProject GalaxymayterminatesuchContentProvider’saccess tothe
Project Galaxy Services.
```
**c) Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent**

If the Content Provider believes that the content that was removed or to which access was
disabled is either not infringing or the Content Provider believes that it has the right to post and
use such content, the Content Provider may send the Designated Agent a counter-notice, which
must contain the following:

```
● ContentProvider’scontactinformation,includingfulllegalname(notthatofa
company)ofthesubmitter,anemailaddress,aphysicaladdress,andaphone
number.
● The location, including any URL, of the contentthat hasbeen removedor
disabled.
● Thefollowingstatement,towhichContentProvidermustagree:"Iconsenttothe
jurisdictionoftheFederalDistrictCourtforthedistrictinwhichmyaddressis
located,orifmyaddressisoutsideoftheUnitedStates,thejudicialdistrictin
which Project Galaxyis located, and willacceptservice ofprocess fromthe
claimant."
● Thefollowingstatement:"Iswear,underpenaltyofperjury,thatIhaveagood

misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."
● Aphysicalorelectronicsignature.Tosatisfythisrequirement,ContentProvider
maytypethesubmitter’sfulllegalname(notthatofacompany)atthebottom
of your electronic counter-notification.
```
If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Project Galaxy may send a copy of the
counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the
removed content or cease disabling it in ten business days.

IfProjectGalaxydoesnotreceivenoticewithintenbusinessdaysthattheoriginalcomplaining

cease disabling accessto thematerialthatwasremoved.Thedecisiontoreplaceorcease
