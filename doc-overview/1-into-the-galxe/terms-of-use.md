To put it simple, Galaxy OATs (on-chain achievement tokens) are a digital record of all your life's achievements.

3. **Galaxy Token**

Project Galaxy aims to build a permissionless, open, and collaborative credential data network. The Galaxy Token (“GAL”) token is an essential component to such infrastructures as it functions as the governance token, incentivizes user participation, and serves as the primary payment token of the Project Galaxy ecosystem. Here are the utilities of GAL:

- **Governance**: GAL is used for voting & governance in Project Galaxy Decntralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO”). GAL token holders have the ability to control the amount of the platform fee collected by the protocol, and control funds held by the Project Galaxy Community Treasury.
- **Paying for Application Module Fee**: Developers who aim to utilize Galaxy’s credential data through Application Modules will be subject to a platform fee (“Platform Fee”) which is charged in GAL.
- **Paying for Galaxy Oracle Engine and Galaxy Credential API**: Developers pay GAL to query our credential data through Galaxy Oracle Engine and Galaxy Credential API. Currently all query fees are waived during beta testing.
- **Curating Digital Credentials**: Curators can utilize the GAL token to signal a credential data set’s value. Each credential data set will include a revenue stream that will be split between credential stake holders pro-rata.
4. **Digital Wallet**

**Digital Wallet.** As part of the Services, you are able to connect your so-called “digital asset wallet” (“Digital Wallet”) to your account. You may be required to provide us additional information to connect your Digital Wallet, such as an email address and password.

5. **User Conduct**

**Prohibited Uses.** You may not use the Services to engage in the following categories of activity ("Prohibited Uses"). The specific types of use listed below are representative, but not exhaustive, and Project Galaxy reserves the right to update or amend such list in its sole discretion at any time, with or without notice to you. These Prohibited Uses are in addition to the Community Guidelines (discussed below). If you are uncertain as to whether or not your use of the Services involves a Prohibited Use or have questions about how these requirements apply to you, please contact us at [support@galaxy.eco]. By becoming a Service User, you agree that you will not use the Services to do or undertake any of the following, as determined by Project Galaxy in its sole discretion:

- **Abusive Activity:** Actions which: (i) impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure, or detrimentally interfere with, intercept, or expropriate any system, data, or information; (ii) transmit or upload any material to the Services that contains viruses, trojan horses, worms or any other harmful or deleterious programs; (iii) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services, other Digital Wallets not belonging to you, computer systems or networks connected to the Services, through password mining or any other means; (iv) use the account of any third party to access or use the Services, except in the case of applications which are specifically authorized by a third party to access such third party’s Digital Wallet and information; or (v) transfer your access or rights to use the Services to a third party, unless by operation of law or with the express permission of Project Galaxy.

For example, certain jurisdictions require their residents to report international money or cryptocurrency transfers that exceed certain amounts. You agree and understand that we do not provide legal, tax, or investment advice. You agree to seek your own advice as necessary, and to comply with any legal obligations you may have in connection with your use of our Services.

6. **Non-Fungible Tokens**

**NFT Acquisition.** Users may have the ability to obtain a non-fungible token (“NFT”) on the Services. A NFT is a record on the distributed public ledger known as the blockchain. Our Service permits users with a User Account to mint NFTs . Users can then offer those NFTs minted on our Service for sale to other users. In order to acquire a NFT on our Services, you will need to have a User Account. To complete your transaction and acquire the NFT, you will need to have the required amount of tokens in your Digital Wallet. When you complete the transaction, it will be recorded on the blockchain and the NFT will be transferred to your Digital Wallet (“NFT Transaction”). Project Galaxy does not claim ownership to any content accessible through the Services and does not endorse any Developer. Project Galaxy operates as a platform connecting users and Developers by minting NFTs for Developers and allowing users to purchase the NFTs. Developers decide the attributes of the NFTs you purchase. Users acknowledge and agree that the NFTs minted and purchased on Project Galaxy are not intended for the purpose of investment or speculation. Users who hold NFTs that are minted and/or purchased on Project Galaxy do not and are not entitled to receive any income or monetary payouts in any form by virtue of their ownership of the NFT.

**Project Galaxy Fee**. Each NFT Transaction is conducted using digital assets in your Digital Wallet. When a Developer lists its NFTs for the initial sale of the Services (“Initial Offering”), the Developer will set the price in digital assets for the NFT Content (as defined below). A fee of 8% of the revenue from the Initial Offering is deducted from the Initial Offering revenues and transferred to Project Galaxy (“Service Fee”).

**Gas Fees**. Creating, buying, selling or transferring NFTs may be subject to fees, commissions, royalties and other charges (“Fees”) established from time to time in the sole discretion of Project Galaxy, Developer, and/or participants in the blockchain ecosystem. On the date of initial publication of these Terms, Fees include service fees established by and payable to Project Galaxy and “gas” (fees paid to miners through users’ Digital Wallet as consideration for mining the NFT Transactions). Service fees may be adjusted from time to time in the sole discretion of Project Galaxy. “Gas” fees are set by the user through the user’s Digital Wallet application, based on the market conditions on the relevant blockchain.

7. **Access to our Services**

Project Galaxy may, at its option and in its sole discretion: (a) suspend or restrict your User Account or Developer Account and/or access to any or all of the Services, and/or (b) deactivate or cancel your User Account or Developer Account and block your access to the Services, if: (i) we are so required by a facially valid subpoena, court order, or binding order of any government authority; (ii) we reasonably suspect you of using the Services in connection with a Prohibited Uses; (iii) your use of the Services is subject to any pending litigation, investigation or government proceeding and/or we, in our sole discretion, perceive a heightened risk of legal or regulatory non-compliance associated with your activity; (iv) any of our service partners are unable to support your use thereof; (v) you take any action that Project Galaxy deems in its sole discretion as circumventing Project Galaxy’s controls, or abusing promotions which Project Galaxy may offer from time to time; or (vi) you breach these Terms.

You acknowledge that Project Galaxy’s decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to, suspending, or disassociating your Digital Wallet from the Services, may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to Project Galaxy’s risk management and/or security protocols. You agree that Project Galaxy is under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management and/or security procedures to you.

9. **DMCA Notice and Procedure for Copyright Infringement Claims**

As Project Galaxy asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others.  Project Galaxy, in appropriate circumstances, may remove from the Services information that might infringe the intellectual property rights of others.  

1) **Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements**

If you believe your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and such infringement is occurring on the Project Galaxy Services, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our Designated Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):

- An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright’s interest;
- A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed, including the URL (i.e., web page address) of the location where the copyrighted work exists or a copy of the copyrighted work;
- Identification of the URL or other specific location on the Project Galaxy Services where the material that you claim is infringing is located; your address, telephone number, and E-mail address;
- A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
- A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your DMCA notice may not be valid and we will have no obligation to respond or acknowledge receipt of your notice. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you misrepresent or make bad faith claims that any material on the Project Galaxy Services infringes your copyrights.  You can contact our Designated Agent via e-mail at DMCA@galaxy.eco.

THE DESIGNATED AGENT SHOULD BE CONTACTED ONLY IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR WORK HAS BEEN USED OR COPIED IN A WAY THAT CONSTITUTES COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND SUCH INFRINGEMENT IS OCCURRING ON THE PROJECT GALAXY SERVICES.  ALL OTHER INQUIRIES DIRECTED TO THE DESIGNATED AGENT WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

2) **Receipt of Proper Infringement Notification**

Once a proper bona fide infringement notification has been received by the Designated Agent, it is Project Galaxy’s policy:

- To remove or disable access to the infringing content;
- To notify the content provider, member, or user (“**Content Provider**”) that it has removed or disabled access to the content; and
- That repeat offenders will have the infringing content removed from the system and that Project Galaxy may terminate such Content Provider’s access to the Project Galaxy Services.
3) **Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent**

If the Content Provider believes that the content that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing or the Content Provider believes that it has the right to post and use such content, the Content Provider may send the Designated Agent a counter-notice, which must contain the following:

- Content Provider’s contact information, including full legal name (not that of a company) of the submitter, an email address, a physical address, and a phone number.  
- The location, including any URL, of the content that has been removed or disabled.
- The following statement, to which Content Provider must agree: "I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of the United States, the judicial district in which Project Galaxy is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant."
- The following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."
- A physical or electronic signature. To satisfy this requirement, Content Provider may type the submitter’s full legal name (not that of a company) at the bottom of your electronic counter-notification.

If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Project Galaxy may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in ten business days.

If Project Galaxy does not receive notice within ten business days that the original complaining party is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the content, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed. The decision to replace or cease disabling access to any content is at Project Galaxy’s sole discretion.

10. **Indemnification**

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Project Galaxy, and our respective past, present and future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, Creators, vendors, service providers, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns (individually and collectively, the “Project Galaxy Parties”), from and against all actual or alleged claims, damages, awards, judgments, losses, liabilities, obligations, penalties, interest, fees, expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expenses) and costs (including, without limitation, court costs, costs of settlement and costs of pursuing indemnification and insurance), of every kind and nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, suspected or unsuspected, in law or equity, whether in tort, contract or otherwise (collectively, “Claims”), including, but not limited to, damages to property or personal injury, that are caused by, arise out of or are related to (a) your use or misuse of the Services, (b) any feedback you provide, (c) your violation of these Terms, and/or (d) your violation of any right(s) of any third party. You agree to promptly notify Project Galaxy of any Claim(s) and shall cooperate fully with the Project Galaxy Parties in defending such Claims. You further agree that the Project Galaxy Parties shall have control of the defense or settlement of any third party Claims. THIS INDEMNITY IS IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT IN LIEU OF, ANY OTHER INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN ANY WRITTEN AGREEMENT(S) BETWEEN YOU AND PROJECT GALAXY.

14. **Dispute Resolution**

**This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully.**

**Informal Process**. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Project Galaxy, you will first contact Project Galaxy and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.

**Agreement to Arbitrate**. After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy or claim (collectively, “Dispute”) relating in any way to these Terms or Project Galaxy’s services and/or products, including but not limited to the Services, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Project Galaxy or any other user of the Services, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies to you and to Project Galaxy. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Dispute by Project Galaxy for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Services that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms, or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases.

**You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Project Galaxy are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.** This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.

If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to: [support@galaxy.eco]

**Arbitration Procedure and Rules**. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), under its rules including the Commercial Arbitration Rules (“Commercial Rules”) by a sole arbitrator. You can access the AAA Commercial Rules at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling +1 800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. You and Project Galaxy shall endeavor to agree upon the arbitrator, and if you and Project Galaxy fail to do so within twenty-one (21) days of the commencement of the Arbitration, the appointment shall be made by AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. Project Galaxy will reimburse those fees for claims where the amount in dispute is less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” section below.

**Class Action Waiver**. **Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff or similar proceeding** (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case or to be a party to a class or representative action is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.

**Waiver of Jury Trial**. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Project Galaxy each waive any right to a jury trial.

15. **Miscellaneous**

**Governing Law and Venue**. These Terms, your access to and use of the Services and Content, and your participation in the Services, shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles of the State of Delaware, or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court, shall be resolved in the state or federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware.

**Severability**. If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.

**Waver**. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.

**Assignability**. These Terms are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Project Galaxy’s express written consent.

**Notices**. All notices under these Terms will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.
