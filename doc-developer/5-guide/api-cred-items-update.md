# Use API to update credential Items

## Prerequisite

1. First you need to create a credential that you want to use in your campaign. Please contact the galaxy BD team if you have no access/experience with Galxe dashboard before, they will help you to walk through the concepts of Galxe dashboard and give you access. 
2. Then you will need an access token bound to your wallet address to use this API. Please go to the Galxe user setting page to generate an access token.

## Endpoint

## Input

1. (header, string, mandatory) access-token: use to auth if you have access to update credential items, the user with this access token must be the credential curator
2. (int, mandatory) credId: the credential id you want to update

   1. APPEND, append items in the list.
   2. REPLACE, remove all items and replace them with items in the list.

## Examples

### Node.js

```typescript
const credId = "123";
const operation = "APPEND";
const items = ["0x123"];

// Nodejs using Axios lib
let axiosRes = await axios.post("https://graphigo.prd.galaxy.eco/query", {
  operationName: "credentialItems",
  query: `
    mutation credentialItems($credId: ID!, $operation: Operation!, $items: [String!]!) 
      { 
        credentialItems(input: { 
          credId: $credId 
          operation: $operation 
          items: $items 
        }) 
        { 
          name 
        } 
      }
    `,
    variables: {
      // Make sure this is string type as int might cause overflow
      credId: credId,
      operation: operation,
      items: items
    },
  },
  {
    headers: {
      "access-token": "access-token-of-yours",
